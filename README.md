# AI-Powered Analytical and Conversational Agents by Peter Preketes

This repository contains three Jupyter notebooks demonstrating various applications of AI-powered agents using the OpenAI API. These notebooks showcase data analysis, multi-agent workflows, and simulated conversations between public figures.

## Notebooks

### 1. Simple Python Agent Workflow

This notebook demonstrates a basic workflow for generating and executing Python code based on user queries.

- **Features:**
  - Generates Python functions based on user queries
  - Automatically creates test cases
  - Executes and validates the generated code
  - Implements a retry mechanism for improved reliability

### 2. Data Analytical Multi-Agent Workflow

This notebook showcases a more complex workflow involving multiple AI agents to perform data analysis on the World Happiness Report dataset.

- **Agents:**
  - Planning Agent: Creates a comprehensive data analysis plan
  - Python Agent: Generates and executes code based on the plan
  - Summarization Agent: Produces a final analysis report

- **Features:**
  - Loads and analyzes real-world data
  - Demonstrates coordination between multiple specialized AI agents
  - Provides in-depth statistical analysis and insights

### 3. Conversation Agent Simulator

This notebook simulates entertaining conversations between two public figures: Donald Trump and Elon Musk.

- **Features:**
  - Mimics the speaking styles and personalities of Trump and Musk
  - Generates back-and-forth dialogues on various topics
  - Showcases the ability to maintain context in multi-turn conversations
