      "\n",
      "1. **Dataset Overview**:\n",
      "    - The dataset contains information on the happiness levels of 155 countries.\n",
      "    - It includes various columns such as 'Country', 'Happiness Rank', 'Happiness Score', 'Whisker.high', 'Whisker.low', 'Economy (GDP per Capita)', 'Family', 'Health (Life Expectancy)', 'Freedom', 'Trust (Government Corruption)', 'Generosity', and 'Dystopia Residual'.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Basic Summary Statistics**:\n",
      "    - Basic summary statistics provide insights into the general trends and distributions in happiness scores and contributing factors.\n",
      "    - For example, statistical measures like mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values can reveal the central tendency and variation in the dataset.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Distribution of Happiness Scores**:\n",
      "    - The distribution of happiness scores observed is approximately normal.\n",
      "    - This was illustrated using a histogram with a kernel density estimate (KDE) overlay, showing how happiness scores are spread across different countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Pairwise Correlation Analysis**:\n",
      "    - Pairwise correlation analysis helps in understanding the relationships between various factors and happiness scores.\n",
      "    - A correlation matrix was generated and visualized using a heatmap. This provides a clear view of which variables are strongly correlated with happiness scores.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Scatter Plots Analysis**:\n",
      "    - Scatter plots were used to explore the relationships between 'Happiness Score' and other factors such as 'Economy (GDP per Capita)', 'Family', 'Health (Life Expectancy)', 'Freedom', 'Trust (Government Corruption)', and 'Generosity'.\n",
      "    - Each scatter plot provides a visual representation of how each independent variable impacts the happiness score.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Linear Regression Analysis**:\n",
      "    - Linear regression analysis was performed to identify the significant factors that influence happiness scores.\n",
      "    - Through this analysis, coefficients corresponding to each factor were obtained, indicating the strength and direction of their impact on happiness scores.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Multiple Linear Regression**:\n",
      "    - A multiple linear regression model was employed to analyze the combined effect of all factors on happiness scores.\n",
      "    - This model takes into account the simultaneous impact of all independent variables and helps in understanding the collective contribution to happiness scores.\n",
      "    - The coefficients from the regression model were reported along with the intercept.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Model Evaluation**:\n",
      "    - The performance of the regression model was evaluated using the R-squared value.\n",
      "    - The R-squared value indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable (happiness score) that is predictable from the independent variables.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Findings:\n",
      "- Economic factors (GDP per Capita), family support, health, and freedom are significant predictors of happiness scores.\n",
      "- Trust in government and generosity also contribute to happiness, although their effects may vary.\n",
      "- The overall model, as indicated by the R-squared value, helps in explaining a substantial portion of the variability observed in happiness scores across countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "This comprehensive analysis highlights the multifaceted nature of happiness and the importance of various socio-economic factors that contribute to the overall well-being of people in different countries.\n"
